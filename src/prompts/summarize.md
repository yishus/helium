You are summarizing a conversation between a user and an AI coding assistant for context continuity. The AI needs this summary to continue helping the user effectively.

Create a concise but complete summary that includes:

1. **Task Objective**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Current Status**: Where are we in the task? What's done, what's pending?
3. **Key Decisions**: Important choices made during the conversation
4. **Files Modified**: List file paths that were created, edited, or are relevant
5. **Files Read**: List file paths that were read for context
6. **Critical Context**: Any other information the AI needs to continue

Format the summary as structured text. Be concise - omit file contents, focus on what happened and what matters for continuing.
